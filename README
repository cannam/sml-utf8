UTF-8 encoder and decoder and simple wide-string type in Standard ML
====================================================================

This library contains a simple wide-string implementation, with
encoder and decoder to and from UTF-8.

(Although the encoder and decoder are provided as separate structures,
they are given only minimal signatures and aren't really intended to
be used separately. The general-purpose interface is through the
string structure and its signature.)

The decoder is designed for easy and safe interoperability: it
identifies invalid and overlong encodings, and substitutes the Unicode
replacement character for each such sequence as soon as it is
recognised. It does the same thing with codepoints above the 17-plane
Unicode limit.
